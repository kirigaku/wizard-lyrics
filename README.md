Lyrics for the vkei band wizard.

grave, breath, イデア, lovely baby, 野良猫, 哀情, 雪崩レ般若, スパイラル, 残り雨, カクテル, Regret, faintly, ヒロイン, Void, the last extremity, くちづけ, 修羅場

are all taken from the website (https://m-pe.tv/u/m/novel/?uid=sadiexkei&id=2). Everything else is from Joysounds.
I am not trying to take credit at all. tbh I'm waiting for my personal emotions to pass.
I thought it was important to have their lyrics in one place. I hope their songs are listened to more even if Kaito is gone.

(also me being an EOP is shameful....orz)
