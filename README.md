are all taken from the website (https://m-pe.tv/u/m/novel/?uid=sadiexkei&id=2). Everything else is from Joysounds.
I am not trying to take credit at all. tbh I'm waiting for my personal emotions to pass.
I thought it was important to have their lyrics in one place. I hope their songs are listened to more even if Kaito is gone.

Eventually I will add more, I bought baby dragstar, so I'm gonna see if I can scan that somehow. There's a ton of stuff that's obviously not here (クライア, etc.)
Submit something if you have it I guess...

(also me being an EOP is shameful....orz)
